# YAMiloTV
Yet Another Milovana Tease Viewer

This project is based on a Node.js server that does some forwarding to the milovana webserver. Most of the code then runs in the users browser.

All scripts are written with a current TypeScript and the project should build with Visual Studio 2017. It's highly unlikely that it builds out of the box, but most things are pretty straightforward if you are familiar with Node.js, Grunt and Typescript.
